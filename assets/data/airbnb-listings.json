So you can organise a shuttle bus from the airport to drop off or pick you up from either of these two hotels!  Price ranges from 15-20AUD. Is Pyrmont safe? Yes!!

Il popolo ebraico \u00e8 presente a Roma dall'epoca di Pompeo, aument\u00f2 sotto Augusto, fino a raggiungere il massimo della conquista sociale ai tempi di Poppea Sabina, moglie di Nerone ed ebrea. Il vero autore del Ghetto fu Paolo IV Carafa che il 14 luglio del 1555 volle separare le abitazioni degli ebrei da quelle dei cristiani, circoscrivendo la zona con cinque \"portoni\" o \"catene\" detti della Rua, Regola, Pescheria, Quattro Capi e Ponte, che venivano chiusi la sera.

L\u2019esecuzione \u00e8 oggi ricordata da una statua eretta nel 1889 d.C. e posta nel centro del Campo dei Fiori su iniziativa del poeta Pietro Cossa ed opera dello scultore Ettore Ferrari. La toponomastica del luogo, che alcuni propongono di far risalire al fatto che una delle amanti dell\u2019Imperatore Pompeo, Flora, avrebbe vissuto in quest\u2019area, \u00e8 pi\u00f9 probabilmente da attribuirsi all\u2019aspetto di totale abbandono che la piazza, invasa da piante e fiori, mostrava nel XV secolo.
